"""PyInstaller creates a single exe file to run a Python script, packaging the necessary Python runtime and packages.

This tool unpacks any single file created by PyInstaller, extracting the main script as either Python bytecode (.pyc)
or Python source code (.py) and the main script's imported Python libraries in an archive (.pyz). It can unpack
PyInstaller files created on Linux, Mac or Windows.
